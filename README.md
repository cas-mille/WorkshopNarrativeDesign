### Suggested Steps
1. **analyse!**   - play around with and analyse the framework   - how does the framework work? what is it capable of? what kind of stories does the structure imply?   - only then:
2. **brainstorm!**
   - what can you do with the framework? what story does fit the structure?
   - frame your vision!
3. **iterate!**
   1. *think / design*
      - visualise your ideas / define features
      - what kind of elements are in your story? how are they related to each other? what can the player do?
   2. *implement / write*
      - code / write / make graphics / record sounds / etc.
      - implement feature after feature, that you always have a complete / playable version
   3. *evaluate / test / analyse*
      - play and let others play
      - analyse
      - what is working? what is not working?
   4. *back to: 1. think / design...*
4. **finalise!**
   - leave yourself time for finalising your project
   - close the gaps / write the credits / remove last bugs / cut out not working parts / etc.
5. **finish!**
   - build & test one more time
   - upload / exhibit / show
