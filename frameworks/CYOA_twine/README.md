# CYOA / Twine

## The Exercise

- download & install [Twine 2.0](http://twinery.org/)
- import & open the example-project with Twine

Please note that Twine 1 and Twine 2 are different and similar at the same time. This can be somethimes quite confusing while reading tutorials and finding solutions online.
